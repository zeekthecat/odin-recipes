        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love indulging in existence and magically triggering a lovely migraine attack. If you're in the mood for excrutiating pain that makes you question whether or not god exists, look no further than this recipe for distaster.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 glass of lukewarm craft IPA</li>
            <li>1 chocolate bar of choice</li>
            <li>1 room with florescent lighting</li>
            <li>4 hours of sleep (less for more painful results)</li>
            <li>1 girl (close proximity) that smells every Bath &amp; Body Works candle melted together</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>Pick a day where you have slept a maximum of four hours. At roughly 7PM, go to a shitty friend's apartment and bring a 4-pack of craft beer. Do not refrigerate on arrival. Ask for a snack, and accept the chocolate bar out of stress and misery of being in a shitty place. Hang out in the kitchen, where florescent lighting is the only means of seeing the hellscape in which you current exist within. Have your shitty friend invite their extra shitty friend named Sasha, who appears to have never left the 90's (and smells like it, too). Stew in your hellscape for a few hours, leaving only when you feel your eyes pounding out of your skull.</p>
