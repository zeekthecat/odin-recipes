        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Choosing to live somewhere spooky as fuck is cool, right? Absolutely. So cool, in fact, that you're on lockdown like COVID times every October because Ashley, Carrie, and Mariah need all the space they can get to show off their Hocus Pocus costumes. Same as last year. And the year before that. And the year before that...</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pair of noise-canceling earbuds</li>
            <li>Willingness to live</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>When it gets loud and spooky outside, pop those earbuds in. Lay down in the fetal position and ask yourself why you thought it was such a good idea to move to a tourist town. Stew in your self-hatred.</p>
