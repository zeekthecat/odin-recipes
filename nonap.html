        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>When you really have to do something but you gotta mess with that tried and true toddler routine, you'll want to ensure that it wraps up with wrath and fury. Ever wrestle pajamas on to a small, screaming, thrashing, weirdly bendy child after a long, extra shitty day? Believe me, you'll love it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <uL>
            <li>1 toddler</li>
            <li>1 skipped afternoon nap</li>
            <li>3 cups of apple juice</li>
            <li>5 mini packets of Welch's fruit snacks</li>
            <li>2 snack cups full of animal crackers</li>
        </uL>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <p>Find your will to live and throw it in the garbage. Explain to toddler that you need to work together to get all the crap you don't want to do done. Under no circumstances should you allow the toddler to sleep. Proceed to offer fruit snacks, animal crackers, and juice to toddler all day long. Fuel their almighty rage. Once you are exhausted, attempt to end your day by offerring a bubble bath to the toddler. Allow them to scream and throw the orange fruit snacks in your face (they hate those ones). Once bath is definitely not happening, proceed with normal night time routine. Get kicked in the face at least three times while begging the toddler to stay in their bed. Enjoy!</p>
